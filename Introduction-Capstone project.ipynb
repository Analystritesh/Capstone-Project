    "For the final capstone project in the IBM certificate course, we want to analyze the accident “severity” in terms of human fatality, traffic delay, property damage, or any other type of accident bad impact. The data was collected by Seattle SPOT Traffic Management Division and provided by Coursera via a link. This dataset is updated weekly and is from 2004 to present. It contains information such as severity code, address type, location, collision type, weather, road condition, speeding, among others.\n",
